# NutriSci
NutriSci is an application dedicated to the improvement of the user’s diet based on set nutrient goals and physical activity. It achieves this through usage of the Canada’s Food Guide to swap food items in the user’s meals to reach target objectives. 
This application is designed to target the issue of the difficulty of reaching nutrition goals based on personal dietary patterns and nutritional information. In the application, users can input their meals for nutritional information and receive tailored recommendations based on the chosen goals (such as increasing fiber, decreasing sugar intake, etc.) with a focus on the minimal amount of changes.
